        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          This is the website of a fictional restaurant. "Sergiosja" is a
          russian version of my first name, Sergey. "de la" roughly translates
          to "of the" in French. "Res" is an abbreviation of the english word
          "Restaurant". As you can see, the title is made up of three languages,
          and makes no sense.
          <br /><br />
          I created the webside because I wanted to implement a cinema-like
          feature you can check out if you attempt to reserve a table. I have
          never seen it on any other restaurant website I have visited in the
          past. Perhaps it is unnecessary, but I personally would not mind to
          know where I will be seated during a restaurant visit. Especially if
          you are to be seated for hours. Do you want to be near the bar? Near
          the bathrooms? As far away from the entrance as possible?

        <p>
          If this was your restaurant, this is probably where you would put your
          adress, your phone number, some email etc. You could also get a visual
          map to make it even easier to see your location.
          <br /><br />
          If you want to contact me, however, you have to reach me on
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergey-jakobsen-b2597a1a4/">
            Linkedin</a
          >. You can also follow me here on
          <a href="https://www.github.com/sergiosja"> GitHub</a>. For the
          especially interested, I also have an
          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sergiosja"> Instagram</a>, though I
          very rarely use it.

          <br /><br />
          If I by any chance have breached some copyright or anything along
          those lines, please feel free to reach me by Email. I will not link it
          here, but it is directly linked from my Instagram, and you can also
          find it on Linkedin, I think.
          <br /><br />
          The last option I will give you is to simply give me
          <em>your</em> email:
          <input type="email" placeholder="Enter email here" id="email" />
          <button onclick="process()">âœ“</button> <br /><br />

          guessed it,
